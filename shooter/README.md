Source code, images, and builds for the Scrolling Shooter tutorial found here: [http://osmstudios.com/tutorials/your-first-love2d-game-in-200-lines-part-1-of-3]()

This game was initially created by [DawsonG](https://github.com/DawsonG/Love2d-Tutorial-Scrolling-Shooter), now I'm using it for doing some experiments with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).
